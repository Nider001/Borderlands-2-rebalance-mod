IMPORTANT STUFF:

* MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER UPGRADE PACKS INSTALLED. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MOD TO RUN CORRECTLY!
* THE LATEST DLC (FIGHT FOR SANCTUARY) IS NOT FULLY TESTED AND BALANCED. EXTERNAL STUFF SUCH AS EXTRA LEVELS IS FINE, BUT OTHERWISE PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK

Changes:

1. Universal Balance Modifier value is reduced from 13% to 1.4%. Things such as weapon damage, shield capacity, certain relic stats, etc. increase by 13% for each level that the player has in vanilla (notice how late-game weapons deal 10000x more damage compared to starting ones). I'm not a big fan of this mechanic, so I've decided to soften the curve a bit
2. Level of gear, missions and enemies is set to scale with player level as in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode
3. Most of the other features from UVHM are disabled (minus new enemy types)
