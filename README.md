IMPORTANT STUFF:

* MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER UPGRADE PACKS INSTALLED. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MOD TO RUN CORRECTLY!

Changes:

1. The mod is designed around playing in UVHM from level 1 (check out installation guide above for details)
2. Most of the features from UVHM are disabled (minus scaling, mission- and loot-related changes)
3. Universal Balance Modifier value is reduced from 13% to 1.4%. Things such as weapon damage, shield capacity, certain relic stats, etc. increase by 13% for each level that the player has in vanilla (notice how late-game weapons deal 10000x more damage compared to starting ones). I'm not a big fan of this mechanic, so I've decided to soften the curve a bit
4. Level requirement is hidden and diabled for every item in the game (level is not everything!)
5. Legendary and Pearlescent items are replaced with Very Rare ones in some of the random enemy drop pools (this includes Loot Midgets to prevent farming)
6. Formula of stat bonuses from Badass Tokens is changed to "0.1 * stat_level" (e.g. +5% after investing 50 tokens into a stat)

13. Slag bonus damage is reduced to 34%
14. Enemy respawn delay is increased
15. Enemy shield capacity is increased to promote the usage of shock weapons
16. Generic enemy grenade damage is tripled (said damage is extremely low in vanilla)

18. Base damage of all SMGs is moderately increased (to the level of vanilla assault rifles)

30. Enemy damage reduction/bonus (that they recieve when level difference between the player and enemy unit is too high) is now capped at 10% when level difference reaches 3

32. Health of main story bosses is increased further 
33. Health of all raid bosses is reduced
34. Hyperius the Invincible is changed to be a bit less boring: health is reduced further, cannons are added to minions (projectiles are easy to dodge)
35. Enemies now have a 30% chance to carry a different weapon type instead of the base one (e.g. Marauders may to use Assault Rifles or Launchers instead of Shotguns). Allowed selection of weapon types varies depending on primary weapon
36. Enemies now drop their weapons upon death
37. Angelic Guards are replaced with SGT Loaders across most of the locations
38. Basic enemy AI (everything that uses standard firearms) is set to prioritize spraying over burst-firing
