IMPORTANT STUFF:

* MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER UPGRADE PACKS INSTALLED. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MOD TO RUN CORRECTLY!
* THE LATEST DLC (FIGHT FOR SANCTUARY) IS NOT FULLY TESTED AND BALANCED. WHILE GENERAL BALANCE SHOULD BE FINE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T FIXED OR LOOKED AT YET

Changes:

1. Universal Balance Modifier value is reduced from 13% to 1.4%. Things such as weapon damage, shield capacity, certain relic stats, etc. increase by 13% for each level that the player has in vanilla (notice how late-game weapons deal 10000x more damage compared to starting ones). I'm not a big fan of this mechanic, so I've decided to soften the curve a bit
2. Level of gear, missions and enemies is set to scale with player level as in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode
3. Most of the other features from UVHM are disabled (minus new enemy types)
4. Level requirement is hidden and diabled for every item in the game (level is not everything!)
5. Legendary and Pearlescent items are replaced with Epic ones in some of the random enemy drop pools (this includes Loot Midgets to prevent farming)
6. Stat bonuses from Badass Tokens are set to diminish much faster with each instance applied
7. Death Penalty Cost (the amount of money you lose after dying in % of your current sum) is increased to 75%

28. Health of main story bosses is increased further 
29. Health of all raid bosses is reduced

41. Torgue Vending Machines no longer sell weapons (excluding item of the day) and provide free ammo instead
