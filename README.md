# Borderlands-2-rebalance-mod
A mix between ultimate vault hunter and normal playthrough mods with some extra changes for refreshing experience

IMPORTANT STUFF:

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER UPGRADE PACKS INSTALLED. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MOD TO RUN CORRECTLY!

Changes:

1. Universal Balance Modifier value is reduced from 13% to 1.5%. Things such as weapon damage, shield capacity, certain relic stats, etc. increase by 13% for each level that the player has in vanilla (notice how late-game weapons deal 10000x more damage compared to starting ones). I'm not a big fan of this mechanic, so I've decided to soften the curve a bit.
2. Level of gear, missions and enemies is set to scale with player level as in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode
3. Most of the other features from UVHM are disabled (minus new enemy types)
4. Death Penalty Cost (the amount of money you lose after dying in % of your current sum) is increased to 20%
5. EXP penalty for killing enemies with vehicle weapons is reduced from 80% to 50%
6. Enemy shield capacity is increased to promote the usage of shock weapons
7. Base damage of Grenade Mods is reduced by 25%, elemental damage is reduced by 50%
8. Launcher ammo pickup ammo count is reduced from 4 to 2
9. Enemies that have higher level compared to the player are set to provide bonus EXP
10. Enemy damage reduction/bonus (that they recieve when level difference between the player and enemy unit is too high) is now capped at 20% when level difference reaches 2
11. Golden Chest is no longer guaranteed to contain purple gear
