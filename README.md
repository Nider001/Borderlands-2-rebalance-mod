IMPORTANT STUFF:

* MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER UPGRADE PACKS INSTALLED. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MOD TO RUN CORRECTLY!
* THE LATEST DLC (FIGHT FOR SANCTUARY) IS NOT FULLY TESTED AND BALANCED. WHILE GENERAL BALANCE SHOULD BE FINE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT I HAVEN'T FIXED OR LOOKED AT YET

Changes:

1. Universal Balance Modifier value is reduced from 13% to 1.4%. Things such as weapon damage, shield capacity, certain relic stats, etc. increase by 13% for each level that the player has in vanilla (notice how late-game weapons deal 10000x more damage compared to starting ones). I'm not a big fan of this mechanic, so I've decided to soften the curve a bit
2. Level of gear, missions and enemies is set to scale with player level as in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode
3. Most of the other features from UVHM are disabled (minus new enemy types)
4. Level requirement is hidden and diabled for every item in the game (level is not everything!)
5. Legendary and Pearlescent items are replaced with Epic ones in some of the random enemy drop pools (this includes Loot Midgets to prevent farming)
6. Stat bonuses from Badass Tokens are set to diminish much faster with each instance applied
7. Death Penalty Cost (the amount of money you lose after dying in % of your current sum) is increased to 100%
8. EXP penalty for killing enemies with vehicle weapons is removed
9. EXP bonus for killing enemies of higher levels is significantly increased
10. EXP rewards for completing missions is increased by 10%
11. Enemy respawn delay is increased
12. Enemy shield capacity is increased to promote the usage of shock weapons
13. Generic enemy grenade damage is tripled (said damage is extremely low in vanilla)
14. Base damage of all assault rifles is significantly increased (to the level of vanilla pistols)
15. Base damage of all SMGs is moderately increased (to the level of vanilla assault rifles)
16. Base damage of all pistols is greatly reduced (to the level of vanilla SMGs)
17. Base damage of all shotguns is increased by 10%
18. Base accuracy of all SMGs is reduced by 10%
19. Base damage of Grenade Mods is reduced by 25%, elemental damage is reduced by 50%
20. Launcher ammo pickup ammo count is reduced from 4 to 2
21. Launcher ammo cost is increased by 50%
22. Item selling costs are reduced by 50%. This does not affect buying costs
23. Enemy damage reduction/bonus (that they recieve when level difference between the player and enemy unit is too high) is now capped at 10% when level difference reaches 3
24. Health of all badass enemies (including bosses) is increased by 50%
25. Health of main story bosses is increased further 
26. Enemies now have a 30% chance to carry a different weapon type instead of the base one (e.g. Marauders may to use Assault Rifles or Launchers instead of Shotguns). Allowed selection of weapon types varies depending on primary weapon
27. Enemies now drop their weapons upon death
28. Basic enemy AI (everything that uses standard firearms) is set to prioritize spraying over burst-firing
29. Cooldown of Gunzerking ability is increased by 50%
30. Golden Chest is no longer guaranteed to contain purple gear
31. Reward for completing 'More History of Simulated Violence' mission is changed to a choice between two random very rare items
32. All Torgue Token drops are doubled
33. Torgue Token rewards for completing tier 3 rematch missions are increased to 50
34. Torgue Vending Machines are no longer allowed to have Legendary gear as an item of the day (replaced with purple gear instead)
35. Torgue Vending Machines no longer sell weapons (excluding item of the day) and provide free ammo instead
36. Bonus enemy stats for extra coop players are significantly reduced
37. Descriptions of Maya's Thoughtlock ability and shields with electrocute damage resistance are fixed
