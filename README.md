IMPORTANT STUFF:

MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BOTH ULTIMATE VAULT HUNTER UPGRADE PACKS INSTALLED. THEY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MOD TO RUN CORRECTLY!

Changes:

1. Universal Balance Modifier value is reduced from 13% to 1.5%. Things such as weapon damage, shield capacity, certain relic stats, etc. increase by 13% for each level that the player has in vanilla (notice how late-game weapons deal 10000x more damage compared to starting ones). I'm not a big fan of this mechanic, so I've decided to soften the curve a bit.
2. Level of gear, missions and enemies is set to scale with player level as in Ultimate Vault Hunter mode
3. Most of the other features from UVHM are disabled (minus new enemy types)
4. Death Penalty Cost (the amount of money you lose after dying in % of your current sum) is increased to 20%
5. EXP penalty for killing enemies with vehicle weapons is reduced to 33%
6. EXP bonus for killing enemies of higher levels is significantly increased
7. Enemy respawn delay is increased
8. Enemy shield capacity is increased to promote the usage of shock weapons
9. Base damage of all pistols is reduced by 10%
10. Base accuracy of all SMGs is reduced by 10%
11. Base damage of Grenade Mods is reduced by 25%, elemental damage is reduced by 50%
12. Launcher ammo pickup ammo count is reduced from 4 to 2
13. Launcher ammo cost is increased by 50%
14. Enemy damage reduction/bonus (that they recieve when level difference between the player and enemy unit is too high) is now capped at 10% when level difference reaches 3
15. Health of all badass enemies (including bosses) is increased by 50%
16. Health of main story bosses is increased further 
17. Enemies now have a 30% chance to carry a different weapon type instead of the base one (e.g. Marauders may to use Assault Rifles or Launchers instead of Shotguns). Allowed selection of weapon types varies depending on primary weapon
18. Basic enemy AI (everything that uses standard firearms) is set to prioritize spraying over burst-firing
19. Cooldown of Gunzerking ability is increased by 50%
20. Golden Chest is no longer guaranteed to contain purple gear
21. Torgue Vending Machines are no longer allowed to have legendary gear as an item of the day (replaced with purple gear instead)
